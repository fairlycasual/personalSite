        My academic work was completed at the University of Utah in the Atmospheric Sciences. <br /> 
        <br />
        As a Research Associate at MesoWest, where I endeavored on large-scale validation of instrumentation for NASA, the GSLO<sub>3</sub>S research campaign, and deployed and maintained a network of surface weather stations.
        <br /> <br />
        I also undertook a research project with Professor Dave Whiteman where we quantified the pollutants transported by fog in Persistant Cold Air Pool events. <br />
