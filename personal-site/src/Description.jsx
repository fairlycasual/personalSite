          I'm a Full-Stack software engineer, skier, and meteorologist.<br />
          I specialize in JavaScript, maintaining strong skills in React, Redux, GraphQL, MVC frameworks, NoSQL, RESTful architectures, HTML, jQuery, Git, and frontend optimization. <br />
          <br />
          Further experience with React Native, Travis CI/CD, Mocha, Chai, Webpack, AWS, Docker, Websockets, SASS, OAuth, Jest/Enzyme, and D3 has been garnered throughout my development pursuits. <br />
          <br />
          My academic work was completed at the University of Utah in the Atmospheric Sciences. I also worked at MesoWest, where I endeavored on large-scale validation of instrumentation for NASA, the GSLO<sub>3</sub>S research campaign, and deployed and maintained a network of surface weather stations.
          I also undertook a research project with Professor Dave Whiteman where we quantified the pollutants transported by fog in Persistant Cold Air Pool events. <br /> 
          <br />
          My most recent project was a client-side caching library for GraphQL applications, you can check it out by clicking <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/wph91"><div>here</div></a> <br />
          From this project I, along with my team, was invited to speak at SoCal React on the topic of GraphQL and frontend optimization for performant applications. <br />
          <br />
          I am available for contract work as I search to fill a full-time developer role, if you're interested, or just want to talk, I look forward to making your acquantaince and the conversation!
